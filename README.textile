h1. My emacs configuration

Please note that much of this is cribbed straight from Chris Wanstrath's config at http://github.com/defunkt/emacs

check into ~/.emacs.d

cd into ~/.emacs.d/

Run the following commands:

git submodule init
git submodule update

The rinari submodule in vendor/rinari has submodules of it's own, so we need to repeat the process:

cd vendor/rinari
git submodule init
git submodule update

Finally, create a file called ~/.emacs and place the following two lines in it:
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d")
(load "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
